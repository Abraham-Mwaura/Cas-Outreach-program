# Cas-Outreach-program
This simple code was used for a primary school outreach program



Lighting an LED

This project is absolute novice rated. Its main aim is to spike interest and sharpen curiosity in primary school kids. Therefore technical terms should be highly abstracted and the project should be narrated as a classical old sweet grandma’s story.

Components used

Arduino Uno / ESP-32
LEDs
Buzzer
Resistor 220ohm
Jumper wires
Arduino Uno Connection

Avoid cable looping, especially for ground lines, and make the wire connection easy to follow from the pin to the component. It’s advisable not to leverage the horizontal and vertical breadboard’s continuities to shun complexity just make direct connections.



Try to come up with a simple algorithm, put it down on paper then write the code. This code can be used for both Arduino and ESP-32. However, esp-32 pin 2 is connected to the onboard LED and one can try switching to pin 4 of ESP-32.
